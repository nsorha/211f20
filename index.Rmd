# About this book

This book describes how to use R as a tool to work with data.  


You’ve mastered research methods, you’ve studied a psychological phenomenon, you’ve identified a need for a study, you’ve planned the study, you’ve developed and preregistered a hypothesis, you’ve collected the data – now what? This guide explains how to use RStudio for data management, data visualization, and data analysis. 

RStudio is a free and flexible statistics program. While there are some things in RStudio that can be done with point and click methods, most things are done with commands, or code. The commands use a programming language called R (which is based on another programming language called S). This guide focuses on aspects of R commands that are practical and relevant for a psychology student. While learning a programming language can be intimidating, it is my hope that the small incremental steps that I use in this guide will make the process of learning how to use RStudio similar to learning a statistics program with more point and click options (like JASP and SPSS). In addition to being useful for coursework and research, having a basic understanding of how to use R commands could help you become comfortable learning the basics of other programming languages for things like editing a website. 
 
The flexibility that RStudio provides often results in several ways to complete the same task. Because different options can be useful in different ways, I will often provide more than one way to run an analysis in this guide.
